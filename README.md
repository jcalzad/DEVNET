## DEVNET Studies

Working on CCIE DEVNET. Hoping to log my studies here along with questions and lab ideas.


### Current focus is Python 
- ssh connectivity
- lab examples
- need to review open/close of files
- need to review api calls via python
- lab lab lab


Also working through organizing notes for DEVNET Associate/Professional as I do want to move through all the certs to _build_ knowledge.
Some folders might not have viewable docs or docs that need to be downloaded. Will work that out though
